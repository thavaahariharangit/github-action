## A practical example

### Scenario
Automatically deploy a website to Netify everytime a new commit is pushed to the main branch

### Implementation
Push a new workflow to the GitHub repo; whenever you push a new commit to main, the workflow will automatically deploy the website to Netlify

Example:

```
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install
      - name: Build website
        run: npm run build
      - name: Deploy to Netlify
        uses: netlify/actions/cli@v1.1
        with:
          site_id: your_netlify_site_id
          api_key: your_netlify_api_key
          args: deploy --prod

```
